# PAI Marketing Plan 2026

**Created:** December 30, 2025
**Target:** 12,000 stars by March 31, 2026
**Current State:** 2,625 stars | 488 forks

---

## Executive Summary

PAI has achieved 2,623 stars in 114 days—slightly ahead of fabric's early trajectory. With Daniel's existing distribution channels (37K fabric stars, YouTube, Newsletter, X), a coordinated 90-day campaign can realistically reach 12,000 stars.

**Core Strategy:** Don't explain PAI. Show it working. Leverage the fabric audience. Create one magic moment.

## The "Magic Moment" Pack

**Critical Gap Identified:** PAI lacks a <5 minute "wow" moment.

**Solution: Voice Pack Quick Demo**

```bash
# Install (30 seconds)
cd $PAI_DIR
./install.sh packs/voice

# Demo (60 seconds)
# User types: "Hey [AI Name]"
# AI responds with personalized greeting using their voice
# "Good morning Daniel. You have 3 tasks from yesterday and a meeting at 2pm."
```

**Why This Works:**
1. Immediate personalization (your name, your voice)
2. Demonstrates memory (knows yesterday's tasks)
3. Shareable (screenshot/video of greeting)
4. Gateway to deeper exploration

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Based on skeptical/contrarian analysis:

| DON'T | WHY | DO INSTEAD |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Launch Discord prematurely | Ghost town without demand | Wait for organic "where to discuss?" |
| Create "marketplace" with 8 packs | Looks sad, not impressive | Wait for 50+ packs |
| Chase SEO for "Personal AI" | Crowded, commoditized | Own "PAI" term specifically |
| Partner with hype influencers | Audience mismatch | Focus on developer content |
| Over-explain in docs | Abstract = forgettable | Show real workflows |
| Optimize for casual users | Dilutes serious community | Add qualifying friction |

---

## Budget & Resources

### Time Investment (Daniel)
| Activity | Hours/Week | 90-Day Total |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Video production | 4 | 48 hrs |
| Pack development | 4 | 48 hrs |
| Social engagement | 2 | 24 hrs |
| Community management | 1 | 12 hrs |
| **Total** | **11** | **132 hrs** |

### External Costs
| Item | Cost | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Thumbnail design | $50/month | YouTube quality |
| Video editing (optional) | $200/video | Scale production |
| **Total 90-Day** | **$750-2,000** | Optional polish |

### ROI Calculation
- 132 hours @ $500/hr opportunity cost = $66,000
- Target: 9,377 new stars
- Cost per star: $7.04
- Compared to fabric ($20/star): **2.8x more efficient**

## Summary

**The 90-Day Mission:** Take PAI from 2,623 to 12,000 stars through consistent "show don't tell" content, fabric audience leverage, and community cultivation.

**Three Big Bets:**
1. **Magic Moment** - One pack that wows in under 5 minutes
2. **fabric Bridge** - Convert 5-10% of 37K fabric users
3. **30-Day Challenge** - Create content flywheel through participants

**What Success Looks Like:**
- 12,000 stars (32% of fabric)
- 2,000 forks
- 10+ community-contributed packs
- PAI mentioned alongside fabric in AI tool discussions

**The Philosophy:** Don't market PAI as a product. Market the *identity* of being someone who has personal AI infrastructure. The software is just the proof.

*"PAI users don't use AI. They ARE AI-augmented."*
