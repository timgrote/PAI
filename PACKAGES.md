## What Are PAI Packs?

PAI Packs are **self-contained functionality bundles** that contain everything your DA needs to implement a specific capability in your personal AI system.

### The Core Concept

```
Traditional approach:
"Here's our codebase, go figure out how to integrate it"
❌ Requires deep understanding of host system
❌ Prone to breaking changes
❌ All-or-nothing integration

PAI Pack approach:
"Here's a complete solution with full context for your DA to integrate"
✅ AI reads the pack and adapts it to YOUR system
✅ Self-contained with all dependencies documented
✅ Pick only what you need
```

### What's in a Pack?

Every PAI pack contains:

1. **Problem Statement** - What's broken or missing?
2. **Solution Overview** - How this pack addresses it
3. **Complete Source Code** - All tools, scripts, CLIs embedded in the markdown
4. **Workflows** - Step-by-step processes and decision trees
5. **Context Files** - Guidelines, specifications, aesthetic rules
6. **Examples** - Real usage scenarios with expected outputs
7. **Installation Instructions** - Both AI-assisted and manual
8. **Testing Procedures** - How to verify it works
9. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and fixes
10. **Credits & Resources** - Attribution and further reading

### Why Single Markdown Files?

**Portability** - Email it, version control it, share it as one file

**AI-Optimized** - Your DA can read the entire context at once without navigation

**Human-Readable** - Open in any text editor, searchable, transparent

**Self-Contained** - No external dependencies for the pack itself (though it may call external tools)

**Easy Review** - See exactly what you're installing before you install it

---

## Pack Format Specification

### File Naming Convention

## Creating a Pack

### Step 1: Identify a Problem

Good packs solve real problems:

- ✅ "I kept manually doing X, so I automated it"
- ✅ "I needed Y capability and built a workflow"
- ✅ "Existing tools don't handle Z well"
- ❌ "I wrote some code once and thought I'd share"
- ❌ "Here's a wrapper around an existing tool with no added value"

**Ask yourself:**
1. Does this solve a real problem I've experienced?
2. Would others benefit from this solution?
3. Is this self-contained enough to be a pack?

### Step 2: Extract the Functionality

If extracting from an existing system:

1. **Identify all dependencies** - What files, tools, APIs does it need?
2. **Document the workflows** - How do you actually use this?
3. **Create examples** - What are real usage scenarios?
4. **Write tests** - How do you know it works?

If building from scratch:

1. **Start with the problem statement** - Be specific
2. **Design the solution** - How will it work?
3. **Build incrementally** - Start simple, add features
4. **Test thoroughly** - On fresh systems if possible

### Step 3: Write the Pack

Use the template above. Fill in every section:

- **Don't skip sections** - Even if brief, include them
- **Real examples, not placeholders** - `example.com` → actual URLs
- **Complete code** - No TODOs, no "implement this later"
- **Test your instructions** - Can someone actually follow them?

### Step 4: Test with AI

Before submitting:

1. Give the pack to YOUR AI
2. Ask it to install the pack
3. See if it works without your help
4. Fix any issues the AI encounters
5. Repeat until installation is smooth

### Step 5: Submit

See [Contribution Process](#contribution-process) below.

---

## Installing Packs

### Method 1: AI-Assisted (Recommended)

**For Claude Code users:**

1. Open the pack markdown file
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste into Claude Code and say:

```
Install this pack into my system. Verify all dependencies,
save the tools to appropriate directories, set up any routing
or hooks needed, and test that it works.
```

Claude will:
- Parse the pack
- Check for required tools/APIs
- Create necessary directories
- Save code to appropriate locations
- Configure any integrations
- Run tests to verify functionality

**For other AI platforms:**

The process is similar - give your DA the pack and ask it to install. The DA should be able to read the pack format and adapt it to your system structure.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer manual control or don't have AI assistance:

1. **Read the pack** - Understand what it does
2. **Check dependencies** - Install required tools
3. **Set up environment** - Configure API keys, env vars
4. **Save the code** - Copy tools to your directories
5. **Follow integration steps** - Skills, hooks, etc
6. **Run tests** - Verify it works

**Recommended directory structure:**

```
~/.your-ai-system/
├── Skills/
│   └── PackName/
│       ├── Tools/
│       │   ├── tool1.ts
│       │   └── tool2.ts
│       ├── Workflows/
│       │   └── workflow.md
│       └── SKILL.md
├── .env (for API keys)
└── settings.json
```

### Method 3: Cherry-Pick

You don't have to install the whole pack:

- **Copy just the code** you need
- **Adapt the workflow** to your process
- **Use as reference** documentation
- **Extract the concept** and implement differently

**Packs are not prescriptive. They're building blocks.**

---

## Pack Lifecycle

### Versioning

PAI packs use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

1.0.0 → 1.0.1   (bug fix, backwards compatible)
1.0.1 → 1.1.0   (new feature, backwards compatible)
1.1.0 → 2.0.0   (breaking change)
```

**When to bump versions:**

- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
  - Bug fixes
  - Documentation improvements
  - Typo corrections

- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
  - New features (backwards compatible)
  - New workflows added
  - New optional parameters

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
  - Breaking changes to APIs
  - Removed features
  - Changed workflows that break existing usage

### Maintenance

**Pack authors are responsible for:**

- Responding to issues about their pack
- Fixing reported bugs
- Considering feature requests
- Updating for dependency changes
- Marking pack as deprecated if abandoned

**If a pack becomes unmaintained:**

- Community can fork and maintain separately
- Can be marked as "community maintained"
- Original author retains credit

### Deprecation

If a pack becomes obsolete:

1. Mark it as `[DEPRECATED]` in the README
2. Explain why (replaced by X, no longer relevant, etc.)
3. Provide migration path if applicable
4. Keep the pack available for reference

---

## Quality Standards

### Must Have (Required for Acceptance)

- ✅ **Clear problem statement** - What does this solve?
- ✅ **Complete working code** - Tested, no placeholders
- ✅ **Real examples** - Actual usage, not hypothetical
- ✅ **Installation instructions** - Both AI and manual
- ✅ **Testing procedure** - How to verify it works
- ✅ **Troubleshooting section** - Common issues
- ✅ **No hardcoded secrets** - Use environment variables
- ✅ **License specified** - MIT preferred for PAI

### Should Have (Strongly Recommended)

- Screenshots of output (for visual packs)
- Video demo or walkthrough
- Multiple examples for different use cases
- Integration notes for popular platforms
- Performance characteristics (if relevant)
- Known limitations documented

### Nice to Have

- Diagram of architecture/flow
- Comparison with alternatives
- Advanced usage patterns
- Customization options
- Related packs integration

### Code Quality

**All code in packs must:**

- Work as described (test it!)
- Follow reasonable conventions for the language
- Include error handling
- Have clear variable names
- Be reasonably efficient
- Be secure (no SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

**Code doesn't need to be:**

- Perfect
- Over-engineered
- Production-grade enterprise quality
- Optimized to death

**The standard:** Would you use this yourself? If yes, it's probably good enough.

## Security Guidelines

### API Keys and Secrets

**NEVER include in packs:**

- ❌ Actual API keys
- ❌ Passwords or tokens
- ❌ Private URLs or endpoints
- ❌ Personal data
- ❌ Internal system details

**Instead:**

- ✅ Use environment variable references (`$API_KEY`)
- ✅ Provide `.env.example` templates
- ✅ Document which keys are needed
- ✅ Link to where to get keys

### Code Security

**Check for:**

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Command injection risks
- XSS in generated output
- Path traversal issues
- Insecure deserial ization

**Best practices:**

- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user data
- Use parameterized queries
- Escape shell commands
- Limit file system access

### Dependency Security

**For external dependencies:**

- Document what they are and why needed
- Check for known vulnerabilities
- Pin versions when possible
- Provide alternatives if available

## FAQs

### Can I submit a pack that uses paid APIs?

**Yes!** Many useful packs require paid services (AI models, specialized APIs, etc.).

Just ensure:
- Clearly document the cost (approximate pricing)
- Provide free alternatives if they exist
- Make it clear it's not free to run

### My pack depends on another pack. Is that OK?

**Yes!** Specify dependencies in the metadata:

```yaml
requires:
  - CORE >= 1.0.0
  - Research >= 2.1.0
```

### Can I update my pack after it's submitted?

**Absolutely!** Pack authors maintain their packs:

1. Make changes
2. Update version number
3. Add to version history
4. Submit PR

### What if someone else submits a pack similar to mine?

**That's fine!** Competition is healthy:

- Different approaches to same problem
- Different trade-offs (speed vs quality, cost vs features)
- Personal preference

Users can choose what works best for them.

### Can I sell premium versions of my pack?

**Yes**, but the version in PAI must be:
- Functional and useful on its own
- MIT licensed
- Free and open-source

You can offer:
- Premium support
- Extended features
- Hosted versions
- Consulting

Just be transparent about what's free vs paid.

### What if my pack breaks due to a dependency update?

**You're responsible for maintaining it:**

1. Update the code to work with new dependency
2. Or pin to older version and document limitation
3. Or mark as deprecated and provide migration path

This is part of being a pack maintainer.

### Can I submit packs for non-Claude platforms?

**Absolutely!** PAI packs should work across platforms:

- OpenCode
- Custom AI systems
- Gemini Code
- GPT-Codex
- Homebrew setups

Just note any platform-specific quirks in the documentation.
